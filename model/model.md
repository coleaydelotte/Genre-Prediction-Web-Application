# Aydelotte Classifier
using the Aydelotte classifier to ensure accuracy
### Must find data to train on
- GTZAN is a good start but going to be issue because we must be able to derive the data from a link or song.
- sample data in file named `sample_data.csv`
- might upgrade model from original ML model to Tensorflow model
- what will be a issue will be finding un biased music for training
